![me](/assets/me.jpg){:.my-image} That's me.

I write code at [Run:AI](http://www.run.ai){:target="_blank"}, mostly in C++, C, and Python.

I have a B.Sc in Computer Science from [The College of Management Academic Studies](http://english.colman.ac.il){:target="_blank"} and an MBA from [Tel-Aviv University](https://english.tau.ac.il){:target="_blank"}.

By now, I had the privilege to work on various technologies and in different domains:
- Cyber (OS-internals, network protocols, RE, etc.)
- Deep-learning (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Horovod)
- GPU virtualization (CUDA, containers)

I published a few [articles](/articles) about deep-learning on [Medium](https://medium.com/@raz.rotenberg){:target="_blank"}.

When I'm not at work, I love making side [projects](/projects) to learn new technologies.
