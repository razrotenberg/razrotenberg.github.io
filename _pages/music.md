I love music.
Whether it's listening to music, creating music, studying music, or just talking about it - I'm in.

Among my favorite artists are John Frusciante, Warpaint, Radiohead, Kevin Parker (Tame Impala), Red Hot Chili Peppers, and more.

I also started listening to jazz (Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Dave Brubeck) a couple of years ago.

I played the guitar for several years, but a few years ago I found out I am more of a drummer.
I currently play in a band, and we are working on some songs.
When I'm not practicing, I transcribe [drum charts](https://musescore.com/razrotenberg){:target="_blank"} and play drum covers.

I enjoy everything related to music, and plan to create more in the future.
