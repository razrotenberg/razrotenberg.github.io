### Hi there! I'm Raz.

I'm a programmer, but I have plenty more things that I find interest in.

I love writing code, and I love music. I still look for the best way to combine the two.

In my spare time, I enjoy [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/97963653-raz-haleva){:target="_blank"} and playing the [drums](/music).

I don't know much about art and philosophy, but I find both appealing;
and if I weren't a programmer, I probably would have been an architect.

I'm always looking for new ideas and will always enjoy making new friends.
Get in touch! e-mail me at <razhaleva@gmail.com>.
